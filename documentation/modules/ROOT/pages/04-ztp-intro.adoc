5G is not only about the speed as in bandwidth, but also as the latency, and one of the key areas being pursued this, is getting the network functions closest to the end-user. 
Nobody said that this could be simple, as it demands a lot of technology and instead of being datacenter-centric, the promises of higher speed and reduced latency, come with a cost: services should be closest to the customer to satisfy them. 

Therefore, telco edge computing presents extraordinary challenges with managing hundreds to tens of thousands of clusters in hundreds of thousands of locations. These challenges require fully-automated management solutions with, as closely as possible, zero human interaction.

*Zero touch provisioning (ZTP)* allows you to provision new edge sites with declarative configurations of bare-metal equipment at remote sites following a GitOps deployment set of practices. All configurations are declarative in nature.

ZTP is a project to deploy and deliver OpenShift 4 in a hub-and-spoke architecture (in a relation of 1-N), where a single hub cluster manages many spoke clusters. The hub and the spokes will be based on OpenShift 4 but with the difference that the hub cluster will manage, deploy and control the lifecycle of the spokes using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM). So, hub clusters running RHACM apply radio access network (RAN) policies from predefined custom resources (CRs) and provision and deploy the spoke clusters using multiple products. We will take a closer look at these components in link:08-ztp-at-scale.html[ZTP components] section.

IMPORTANT: ZTP can have two scenarios, connected and disconnected, wether the OpenShift Container Platform Worker nodes can directly access the internet or not. In our lab and for telco deployments, disconnected scenario is the most common.

ZTP provides support for deploying single node clusters, three-node clusters, and standard OpenShift clusters. This includes the installation of OpenShift and deployment of the distributed units (DUs) at scale. In this lab, we will focus on SNO clusters which was a topic discussed in link:02-sno-intro.html[Introduction to Single Node OpenShift (SNO)].
