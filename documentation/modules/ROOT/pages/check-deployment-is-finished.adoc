= Check SNO Deployment is Finished
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:profile: 5g-ran-lab

In the previous section we have learned how to follow the cluster deployment process, but the cluster finished its deployment doesn't mean that the SNO deployment is complete.

We say that the SNO deployment finished when the SNO cluster has been deployed *and* day2 configurations has been applied. In this section we will learn how to verify that the configs have been applied and our SNO is ready to run 5G RAN workloads.

[#check-sno-deployment-webui]
== Check SNO Deployment has Finished via the WebUI

1. Access the https://console-openshift-console.apps.hub.5g-deployment.lab/multicloud/home/welcome[RHACM WebUI] and login with the OpenShift credentials.
2. Once you're in, click on `Infrastructure` -> `Clusters`. You will see a screen like the one below, notice that there is a label saying `ztp-done` for the SNO2 cluster (that means ztp pipeline has finished).

+
3. Additionally, we can verify that all policies are compliant for our SNO cluster. On the RHACM WebUI go to `Governance` -> `Policies` and you will see the following screen where we can see all policies are green.
+
IMPORTANT: Applying policies on `sno2` can take up to 15 minutes after cluster has been fully deployed.

4. At this point the SNO is ready ro tun 5G RAN workloads.

[#check-sno-deployment-cli]
== Check SNO Deployment has Finished via the CLI

IMPORTANT: Below commands must be executed from the workstation host if not specified otherwise.

1. Check the `ManagedCluster` for SNO2 cluster (including its labels). You should see the `ztp-done` label, just as we saw in the WebUI.
