= Managing Existing Clusters
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:profile: 5g-ran-lab

If we have clusters that have been provisioned outside the ZTP GitOps Pipeline, we still can get them added to RHACM and start managing them with the pipeline.

In the lab environment we have a SNO cluster `SNO1` that was deployed outside the ZTP GitOps Pipeline, in this section we will get it added to RHACM and make it load the policies we have for SNO clusters.
