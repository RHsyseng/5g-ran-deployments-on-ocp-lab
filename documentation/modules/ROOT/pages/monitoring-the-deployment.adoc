Once the ZTP GitOps Pipeline starts deploying our clusters we can follow the installation status via the WebUI or the CLI.

[#monitoring-deployment-webui]
== Monitoring the Deployment via the WebUI

WARNING: It may take a while for the installation to start, wait at least 10 minutes if you see `The cluster is not ready for installation` message or the `SNO2` cluster shows up as `draft`.

1. Access the https://console-openshift-console.apps.hub.5g-deployment.lab/multicloud/home/welcome[RHACM WebUI] and login with the OpenShift credentials.
2. Once you're in, click on `Infrastructure` -> `Clusters`. You will see a screen like the one below if the deployment has not yet started:

+
3. Eventually, the `SNO2` cluster will start its deployment:
+
image::acm-clusterview.png[RHACM Cluster View]
+
4. In order to check the deployment status of the `sno2` cluster, click on `sno2` and you will get presented this screen:
+
image::acm-sno2-view.png[RHACM sno2 Cluster View]
+
5. You can follow the progress here, if you want to get extra details you can click on `View Cluster Events` and you should see more information:

+
6. Deployment will eventually finish:

[#monitoring-deployment-cli]
== Monitoring the Deployment via the CLI

IMPORTANT: Below commands must be executed from the workstation host if not specified otherwise.

1. Check the `AgentClusterInstall` for SNO2 cluster
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
-----
oc --kubeconfig ~/5g-deployment-lab/hub-kubeconfig -n sno2 get agentclusterinstall sno2
-----
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
-----
NAME   CLUSTER   STATE
sno2   sno2      finalizing
-----
+
2. In case you want expanded information like we saw in the WebUI you can check the conditions of the `AgentClusterInstall` object. For example, while installing:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
-----
- lastProbeTime: "2023-03-18T16:18:20Z"
  lastTransitionTime: "2023-03-18T16:18:20Z"
  message: 'The installation is in progress: Finalizing cluster installation. Cluster
    version status: progressing, message: Working towards 4.12.3: 523 of 829 done
    (63% complete)'
  reason: InstallationInProgress
  status: "False"
  type: Completed
-----
+
3. Once installed:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
-----
- lastProbeTime: "2023-03-18T17:05:20Z"
  lastTransitionTime: "2023-03-18T17:05:20Z"
  message: 'The installation has completed: Cluster is installed'
  reason: InstallationCompleted
  status: "True"
  type: Completed
-----

IMPORTANT: `SNO2` cluster installation takes around 50 minutes to complete.

While the `SNO2` cluster installs, let's move to the next section where we will learn how to add an existing cluster to RHACM and get it managed by the ZTP GitOps Pipeline.
