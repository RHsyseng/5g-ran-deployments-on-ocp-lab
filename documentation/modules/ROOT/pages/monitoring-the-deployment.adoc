Once the ZTP GitOps Pipeline starts deploying our clusters we can follow the installation status via the WebUI or the CLI.

== Monitoring the Deployment via the WebUI

1. Access the https://multicloud-console.apps.hub.5g-deployment.lab/[RHACM WebUI] and login with the OpenShift credentials.
2. Once you're in, click on `Infrastructure` -> `Clusters`. You will see a screen like the one below:
+

+
3. In order to check the deployment status of the `sno2` cluster, click on `sno2` and you will get presented this screen:
+
image::acm-sno2-view.png[RHACM sno2 Cluster View]
+
4. You can follow the progress here, if you want to get extra details you can click on `View Cluster Events` and you should see more information:

5. Deployment will eventually finish:

[#monitoring-deployment-cli]
== Monitoring the Deployment via the CLI

IMPORTANT: Below commands must be executed from the workstation host if not specified otherwise.

1. Access the Hub cluster as admin
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
-----
oc login -u admin -p admin https://api.hub.5g-deployment.lab:6443
-----
+
2. Check the `AgentClusterInstall` for SNO2 cluster
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
-----
oc -n sno2 get agentclusterinstall sno2

NAME   CLUSTER   STATE
sno2   sno2      finalizing
-----
+
3. In case you want expanded information like we saw in the WebUI you can check the conditions of the `AgentClusterInstall` object. For example, while installing:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
-----
- lastProbeTime: "2022-12-01T17:53:42Z"
  lastTransitionTime: "2022-12-01T17:53:42Z"
  message: 'The installation is in progress: Finalizing cluster installation.
    Cluster version status: available, message: Done applying 4.11.13'
  reason: InstallationInProgress
  status: "False"
  type: Completed
-----
+
4. Once installed:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
-----
- lastProbeTime: "2022-12-01T18:00:00Z"
  lastTransitionTime: "2022-12-01T18:00:00Z"
  message: 'The installation has completed: Cluster is installed'
  reason: InstallationCompleted
  status: "True"
  type: Completed
-----

While the `SNO2` cluster installs, let's move to the next section where we will learn how to add an existing cluster to RHACM and get it managed by the ZTP GitOps Pipeline.
