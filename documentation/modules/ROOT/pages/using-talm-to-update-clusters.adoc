= Using TALM to Update Clusters
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:profile: 5g-ran-lab

In this section we will perform a platform upgrade to both managed clusters using the pre-cache and backup feature implemented in the Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM) operator. The pre-cache feature prepares the maintenance operation in the managed clusters by pulling the required artifacts prior to the upgrade. The reasoning behind this feature is that SNO spoke clusters may have limited bandwidth to the container registry, which will make it difficult for the upgrade to complete within the required time. In order to ensure the upgrade can fit within the maintenance window, the required artifacts need to be present on the spoke cluster prior to the upgrade. The idea is pre-caching all the images needed for the platform and operator upgrade on the node, so they are not pulled at upgrade time. Do it in a maintenance window(s) before the upgrade maintenance window.

The backup feature, on the other hand, implements a procedure for rapid recovery of a SNO in the event of a failed upgrade that is unrecoverable. The SNO needs to be restored to a working state with the previous version of OCP without requiring a re-provision of the application(s).

Let's upgrade our both clusters. First of all, let's verify the TALM operator is running in our **hub cluster**:

Next, double check there is no problem with the Pod. Notice that the name of the Pod is cluster-group-upgrade-controller-manager, based on the name of the upstream project https://github.com/openshift-kni/cluster-group-upgrades-operator[Cluster Group Upgrade Operator].

Finally, let's take a look at the cluster group upgrade (CGU) CRD managed by TALM. If we pay a closer look we will notice that an already completed CGU was applied to SNO2. As we mentioned in link:talm.html#inform-policies[inform policies] section, all policies are not enforced, the user has to create the proper CGU resource to enforce them. However, when using ZTP we want our cluster provisioned and configured automatically. This is where TALM will step through the set of created policies (inform) and will enforce them once the cluster was successfully provisioned. Therefore, the configuration stage starts without any intervention ending up with our OpenShift cluster ready to process workloads.

WARNING: It's possible that you get `UpgradeNotCompleted`, if that's the case you need to wait for the remaining policies to be applied. You can check policies status https://console-openshift-console.apps.hub.5g-deployment.lab/multicloud/governance/policies[here].

[#getting-snos-kubeconfigs]
== Getting the SNO clusters kubeconfigs

In the previous sections we have deployed the `sno2` cluster and attached the `sno1` cluster. Before we continue with TALM, let's grab the kubeconfigs for both cluster since we will need them for the next sections.

-----

[#upgrade-policy-creation]
== Creating the upgrade PGT

Create an upgrade PGT in inform mode, as usual, that will apply and upgrade both SNO1 and SNO2 clusters. This file needs to be created in the ztp-repository Git repo that we have created.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
-----
cat <<EOF > ~/5g-deployment-lab/ztp-repository/site-policies/zone-policies/upgrade-411-17.yaml

            state: "Completed"
EOF
-----

Modify the kustomization.yaml inside the site-policies folder, so it includes this new PGT and eventually will be applied by ArgoCD.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
-----
sed -i "/- zone-policies\/zone-europe.yaml/a \ \ - zone-policies/upgrade-411-17.yaml" ~/5g-deployment-lab/ztp-repository/site-policies/kustomization.yaml
-----

Then commit all the changes:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
-----
cd ~/5g-deployment-lab/ztp-repository/
git add site-policies/zone-policies/upgrade-411-17.yaml site-policies/kustomization.yaml
git commit -m "adds upgrade policy"
git push origin main 
-----

Once committed, in a couple of minutes we will see a new policy in the multicloud RHACM console. As noticed, the policy named europe-upgrade-version-411-17 has a violation. However, only one. If we check the policy information we will see that this policy is only targeting SNO2 cluster. That's because the SNO1 cluster does not have the label zone-europe that the PGT is targeting in its binding rule. 


image::talm_upgrade_policy_01.png[TALM upgrade policy 1]

Let's add the proper label to SNO1:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
-----
oc --kubeconfig ~/5g-deployment-lab/hub-kubeconfig label managedcluster sno1 du-zone=europe
-----

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
-----
managedcluster.cluster.open-cluster-management.io/sno1 labeled
-----

Notice that now there are two violations in our upgrade policy. 

IMPORTANT: There is an extra violation in the zone-europe-storage-operator since this PGT was created previously to adding the label to SNO1. That's because that policy is bound to du-zone=europe as well. However, we have the choice to apply it (enforce) or not using the TALM operator.

image::talm_upgrade_policy_02.png[TALM upgrade policy 2]


[#upgrade-cgu-creation]
== Applying the upgrade

At this point we need to create a CGU resource that will start the upgrade process. In our case, the process will be divided into two stages:

1. Run a backup prior to start the upgrade process. Once successfully TALM will pre-cache all container images required for upgrade
2. Start the upgrade process

[#talm-backup-precache]
=== Backup and pre-cache

Let's create the CGU. In this case, we will apply the managed policy (europe-upgrade-version-411-17) to both clusters at the same time (maxConcurrency is 2). Notice that the CGU is disabled, this is suggested if we are going to run the precaching feature. This means, that once the precaching process is done we are ready to start the upgrade process. This idea is related to the compliance of a maintenance window in an enterprise. 

Remember that several gigabytes of artifacts needs to be downloaded to the spoke for a full upgrade. SNO spoke clusters may have limited bandwidth to the hub cluster hosting the registry, which will make it difficult for the upgrade to complete within the required time. In order to ensure the upgrade can fit within the maintenance window, the required artifacts need to be present on the spoke cluster prior to the upgrade. Therefore, the process is split up into two stages as mentioned.

image::timing.png[TALM maintenance window concept]

Let's apply the CGU to our hub cluster:

  managedPolicies:

  remediationStrategy:
    maxConcurrency: 2
    timeout: 240
EOF
-----

Once applied, we can see that the status moved to BackupNotDone. This means that the first step in our process is executing the backup.

This job basically runs a Pod that will execute a recovery procedure and will store all required data into the /var/recovery folder of each spoke.

Once done, the next step is the precache phase as we can see from the CGU status.

The approach is very similar to the backup, a new job called pre-cache is created on each spoke cluster.

=== Triggering the upgrade

Now, we have our backup done in case of upgrade failure and all the images required to perform the upgrade process locally store to each spoke cluster. Notice that this will improve the time needed to fulfill the process, since there is no need to pull down all the gigabytes of container images again. Let's start the upgrade process by enabling the CGU:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
-----
oc ~/5g-deployment-lab/hub-kubeconfig patch cgu telco-ops -n  ztp-policies --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"enable":true}}'

Notice the CGU state moved to UpgradeNotCompleted, which means, the upgrade process has started.

If we connect to any of our spoke clusters we can see that the upgrade process is actually taking place.

Meanwhile, the clusters are upgrading we can take a look at the https://console-openshift-console.apps.hub.5g-deployment.lab/multicloud/governance/policies[multicloud console] and see that there is a new policy in enforce mode

image::talm_upgrade_policy_03.png[TALM upgrade policy 3]

Moving to the Infrastructure -> Cluster section of the multicloud console we can also graphically see the upgrading of both clusters

image::talm_upgrade_policy_04.png[TALM upgrade policy 3]

Finally, our clusters are upgraded:

Notice that now the upgrade policy (europe-upgrade-version-411-17) is now compliant on both clusters. See that the enforce policy is removed once the CGU is successfully applied and the non-compliant policy (zone-europe-storage-operator) is still in the same state since we do not remediate it in our CGU.
